# Entry #10: Final Thoughts and Learning Functional Programming

This term, I completed many exercises and assignments that were written in a functional programming language; Haskell. Although I was able to complete them and do decently well on these assignments, I still for some reason have the feeling that I still do not completely understand everything I did or functional programming in itself. However, after reading a few articles by Charles Scalfani, I am feeling slightly better about my unsurety.

The articles I read are "[Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/goodbye-object-oriented-programming-a59cda4c0e53#.p6vn7xvdj)" along with "[Why is Learning Functional Programming So Damned Hard?](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/why-is-learning-functional-programming-so-damned-hard-bfd00202a7d1)". Both of these were great articles and I thoroughly enjoyed my time reading them. 

When I was first learning Functional Programming through Haskell (although I still feel these struggles), I was blindsided by how difficult it was compared to learning another Object Oriented Programming Language. As I mentioned in my second blog post, the transition between Object Oriented Programming languages is almost seamless. This seamless transition was not what I experienced when learning Haskell. With the growing difficulties I had experienced learning Haskell, I thought I loved Object Oriented Programming and would never talk badly about or discuss my frustrations with it ever again. However, after reading [Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/goodbye-object-oriented-programming-a59cda4c0e53#.p6vn7xvdj), I remembered all my frustrations re-arose. Scalfani brings up the Three Pillars of OOP (Inheritence, Encapsulation, and Hierarchies), why we initially adore them, and eventually their pitfalls. In the end, Scalfani concludes that Functional Programming is the new wave and the superior language type. While I do run into the pitfalls Scalfani discussed in this article, I am still partial to OOP as this is currently all I know. I'm sure if I were to dive deeper into and fully embrace Functional Programming, it would shed some light to his conclusion, but for now I will gladly take Java, Python, C, or C++ over Haskell.  

Hearing Scalfani's own struggles in "[Why is Learning Functional Programming So Damned Hard?](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/why-is-learning-functional-programming-so-damned-hard-bfd00202a7d1)" definitely put me at ease with the road blocks I experinced while trying to learn Haskell. He recounts that learning Haskell was "the hardest thing [he] had to do in [his] career" and had attemped to learn Functional Programming numerous times before to no avail. Further down the read, he mentions how Haskell is "like college" and the jump in trying to learn Haskell (as a first Functional Programming language) is like jumpting from kindergarten to college. This jump is exactly what I felt in the course that I took. While I only scratched the surface of learning Haskell, it felt tough nonetheless. 

While Haskell felt very challenging for me to grasp, I am still glad I got a taste of what Functional Programming is. Functional Programming reminded me a lot of a course I took called "Introduction to Computer Systems" where we stripped everything down and really got into the basics of operating systems. If I were to do it over again, I would definitely scour the internet for resources on learning Haskell much sooner than I did in the semester. Learning Haskell is definitely a task that takes real time and dedication to sitting down to fully understand it. Hopefully I will pick up where I left off in learning Haskell sometime soon, or maybe I'll just take Scalfani's advice and start from kindergarten next time.
