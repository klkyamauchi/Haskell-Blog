# Entry #9: Turing Completeness and Lambda Calculus

I think every student of computer science has at least heard of the Turing Machine and the man behind it, Alan Turing. Before learning about the Turing Machine in class, I was first introduced to Alan Turing through the 2014 movie "The Imitation Game". I was really fond of this movie, although heartbreaking, it follows Turing's work acting alongside a team of other codebreakers to crack Nazi encryptions and the Engima. 

Besides his work during WWII, Alan Turing was a mathematician and computer scientist who paved the way for computer science itself as well as artifical intelligence. He is best known for the Turing Machine and the Turing Test. The Turing Test is utilized in AI to determine whether a computer can act as a human. A Turing Machine is a mathematical model of computation that manipulates a string of logic and is the basis of all modern computers. The strongest programs are "Turing Complete" and happens when a computer can do what a Turing Machine can do. So, a Turing Machine can do anything that a computer can do but not necessarily the other way around. Turing machines are actually functionally equivalent to lambda calculus. Abstract machines are deemed "Turing Complete" if a system in which a program can be written has an answer (as a Turing Machine is able to solve all computational problems). 

Most programming languages are Turing Complete including Lambda Calculus. Most are Turing Complete because they implement all the necessary features to run programs. Along with its innate similarities to the Turing Machine itself, Lambda Calculus does not require outside mathematical dependencies but utilizes alpha and beta reductions as well as it's ability to solve recusrive problems helps its proof in being Turing Complete.
